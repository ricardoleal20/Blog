      <description>Snowball Rolling    Suppose that we had a inclinated plane with a snowball in the higher zone. At the end onf that plane, there is a tree that requires a force of $25000N$ to get broke. The equations for the dynamics moves of the snowball are:
\begin{equation} \Large\begin{array}{c} \frac{dm}{dt}=\beta K_0e^{-\beta t} \\
\frac{dr}{dt}=\frac{\beta K_0e^{-\beta t}}{4\pi\rho r^2} \\
\frac{dx}{dt}=v \\
\frac{dv}{dt}=-\frac{15\rho_aC_d}{56\rho}\frac{v^2}{r}-\frac{23v}{7r}\frac{\beta K_0e^{-\beta t}}{4\pi\rho r^2}+\frac{5}{7}gsin(\theta) \end{array} \end{equation}
While the impact force is $F=\frac{K_E}{r}$, where $K_E$ is the kinetic energy.</description>

      <description>Traffic flow, revisited    As we can remember, on the first codes that I made for this blog was Traffic Flow, which had the following conservaton law
\begin{equation} \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}=0 \end{equation}
where $F$ is the flux, $F=\rho u$. We can remember that a linear relation between the traffic speed and traffic density can be:
\begin{equation} F(\rho)=\rho u_{max}\left(1-\frac{\rho}{\rho_{max}}\right) \end{equation}
This flux model meets the two requirements, based on a qualitative view of traffic flow, that:</description>

      <description>Solve the Heat equation.    A very know PDE is the heat equation. It&amp;rsquo;s a very importan equation that describes the distribution of heat in a structure or space in a certain time.
The PDE looks like this:
\begin{equation} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}=\alpha\frac{\partial^2T}{\partial x^2}+f(T) \end{equation}
where $T$ is the temperature of the system, $\alpha$ is the thermal diffusion constant and $f(T)$ is a function that apply to our system.</description>

      <description>SIR model    The SIR model is a couple of differential equations that work together. That system is
\begin{equation} \Large\begin{array}{c} \frac{dS}{dt}=-\beta SI \\\
\frac{dI}{dt}=\beta SI-vI \\\
\frac{dR}{dt}=vI \end{array} \end{equation}
In this equation, $S$ are the susceptible individuals, $I$ are the infected individuals and $R$ are the Recovered individuals. $\beta$ are the rate of individuals per period that become infected and $v$ are the rate of individuals per period that become recovered.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the tympanic membrane with the wave equation.</title>

      <description>Modeling the vibrational behavior in a isotropic model of the tympanic membrane.    The tympanic membrane is a structure that resides in our ear. The behavior of that little membrane can be modeled by the wave equation:
\begin{equation} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}=c^2\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2} \end{equation}
This equation will be constrained by the values:
\begin{equation} 0&amp;lt;x&amp;lt;l\hspace{2mm} \land\hspace{2mm} 0&amp;lt;t&amp;lt;t_f \end{equation}
The boundary conditions of our system will be:
\begin{equation} u(0,t)=u(l,t)=0 \hspace{2mm} \end{equation}</description>

      <description>This code was made for the course Practical Numerical Methods with Python. This is the solution for the second homework.
Consider the flow of traffic on a one-lane highway. How can we describe the general behavior of this system?
We can define the speed of traffic, $V$, in kilometers per hour. We can also deffine a traffic density, the number of cars per unit length of highwai, $\rho$, in cars per kilometer.</description>

      <description>This code was made for the course Practical Numerical Methods with Python. This is the solution for the first homework.
The equations of motion for a rocker in purely vertical flight are given by:
\begin{equation} \begin{array}{c} \frac{dh}{dt}=v \\\
(m_s+m_p)\frac{dv}{dt}=-(m_s+m_p)g+\dot{m}_pv_e-\frac{1}{2}\rho v|v|AC_D \end{array} \end{equation}
 $h$ is the altitude of the rocket. $m_s$=50kg is the weight of the rocket shell. $g$=9.81 $\frac{m}{s^2}$ $\rho$=1.091 $\frac{kg}{m^3}$ is the average air density (assumed constant throughout flight).</description>

      <description>Hi! My name is Ricardo.    I&amp;rsquo;m a physics student. curently at my last semester, specializing in computer applied mathematics. I have experience in the application of mathematics for modeling and simulation, as well as numerical data analysis. I have been in several summer schools, courses and projects that have given me the opportunity to hone my skills and open my perspective on what I can do with them.</description>

Simulate an epidemic with SIRS model.      
This project is a web application that let the user define the value of some parameters and look how that works to solve the SIRS model. The project was done in Python and deploy in Heroku.</description>
