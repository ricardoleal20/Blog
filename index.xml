      <description>Reaction-Diffusion    Gray-Scott model    The Gray Scott model simulates the interaction of two generic chemical species reacting and diffusing in a spatial domain. This can create an accurate behavior of the chemical species if you use the correct values. Also, creates an amazing patterns, it&amp;rsquo;s awesome!
The Gray Scott model follows some simple rules. Given two sets of virtual particles $u$ and $v$:
 There&amp;rsquo;s a constant feed rate of $u$ particles into the system If two $v$ particles meet a $u$ particle, the convert it into a another $v$ particle.</description>

      <description>Simulate a diffusion problem in 2D.    In the past, I had solve the heat equation in 1 dimension, using the explicit and implicit schemes for the numerical solution. So now, what about go one step beyond that and now study how work the 2D heat equation?
But hey, like I solved the heat equation before, why not now solve the Reaction-Diffusion equation? It&amp;rsquo;s esentially the same for let&amp;rsquo;s see that equation.</description>

      <description>Shock Tube    A shock tube is an idealized device that generates a one-dimensional shock wave in a compressible gas. The setting allows an analytical solution of the Euler equations, which is very useful for comparing with the numerical results to assess their accuracy.
Picture a tube with two regions containing gas at different pressures, separated by an infinitely-thin, rigid diaphragm. The gas is initially at rest, and the left region is at a higher pressure than the region to the right of the diaphragm.</description>

      <description>Graduate admission using Machine Learning    The graduate admission can be really tough for most of the students. As a student that want to form part of a graduate school, i wonder myself, what are my chance to get into one of this schools?
In the webpage Kaggle, i found this incredible dataset that collect data from undergraduate students, such as the University Rating (the University place where study their undergraduate), their CGPA, their TOEFL Score and others.</description>

      <description>Burgers with MacCormack    Conside the 1D Burgers equation:
\begin{equation} \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=-u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \end{equation}
We want to represent this in conservative forms so that we can better deal with potential shocks, which gives us:
\begin{equation} \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial }{\partial x}\left(\frac{u^2}{2}\right) \end{equation}
We can also write this as:
\begin{equation} \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=-\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} \end{equation}
If we take $F=\frac{u^2}{2}$. Start with a Heaviside function (a sep function) with the following values:</description>

      <description>North america change in temperature    In this project, I decide to make a comparison in North America to check the $CO_2$ emittions and the temperature change between the years. In particular, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna work with United States, Canada and Mexico. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna check how many $CO_2$ produce every country from 1960 until now, and also check the average temperature.
First, let me import the libraries to use</description>

      <description>Snowball Rolling    Suppose that we had a inclinated plane with a snowball in the higher zone. At the end onf that plane, there is a tree that requires a force of $25000N$ to get broke. The equations for the dynamics moves of the snowball are:
\begin{equation} \Large\begin{array}{c} \frac{dm}{dt}=\beta K_0e^{-\beta t} \\
\frac{dr}{dt}=\frac{\beta K_0e^{-\beta t}}{4\pi\rho r^2} \\
\frac{dx}{dt}=v \\
\frac{dv}{dt}=-\frac{15\rho_aC_d}{56\rho}\frac{v^2}{r}-\frac{23v}{7r}\frac{\beta K_0e^{-\beta t}}{4\pi\rho r^2}+\frac{5}{7}gsin(\theta) \end{array} \end{equation}
While the impact force is $F=\frac{K_E}{r}$, where $K_E$ is the kinetic energy.</description>

      <description>Traffic flow, revisited    As we can remember, on the first codes that I made for this blog was Traffic Flow, which had the following conservaton law
\begin{equation} \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}=0 \end{equation}
where $F$ is the flux, $F=\rho u$. We can remember that a linear relation between the traffic speed and traffic density can be:
\begin{equation} F(\rho)=\rho u_{max}\left(1-\frac{\rho}{\rho_{max}}\right) \end{equation}
This flux model meets the two requirements, based on a qualitative view of traffic flow, that:</description>

      <description>Solve the Heat equation.    A very know PDE is the heat equation. It&amp;rsquo;s a very importan equation that describes the distribution of heat in a structure or space in a certain time.
The PDE looks like this:
\begin{equation} \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}=\alpha\frac{\partial^2T}{\partial x^2}+f(T) \end{equation}
where $T$ is the temperature of the system, $\alpha$ is the thermal diffusion constant and $f(T)$ is a function that apply to our system.</description>

      <description>SIR model    The SIR model is a couple of differential equations that work together. That system is
\begin{equation} \Large\begin{array}{c} \frac{dS}{dt}=-\beta SI \\\
\frac{dI}{dt}=\beta SI-vI \\\
\frac{dR}{dt}=vI \end{array} \end{equation}
In this equation, $S$ are the susceptible individuals, $I$ are the infected individuals and $R$ are the Recovered individuals. $\beta$ are the rate of individuals per period that become infected and $v$ are the rate of individuals per period that become recovered.</description>

      <description>Modeling the vibrational behavior in a isotropic model of the tympanic membrane.    The tympanic membrane is a structure that resides in our ear. The behavior of that little membrane can be modeled by the wave equation:
\begin{equation} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}=c^2\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2} \end{equation}
This equation will be constrained by the values:
\begin{equation} 0&amp;lt;x&amp;lt;l\hspace{2mm} \land\hspace{2mm} 0&amp;lt;t&amp;lt;t_f \end{equation}
The boundary conditions of our system will be:
\begin{equation} u(0,t)=u(l,t)=0 \hspace{2mm} \end{equation}</description>

      <description>This code was made for the course Practical Numerical Methods with Python. This is the solution for the second homework.
Consider the flow of traffic on a one-lane highway. How can we describe the general behavior of this system?
We can define the speed of traffic, $V$, in kilometers per hour. We can also deffine a traffic density, the number of cars per unit length of highwai, $\rho$, in cars per kilometer.</description>

      <description>This code was made for the course Practical Numerical Methods with Python. This is the solution for the first homework.
The equations of motion for a rocker in purely vertical flight are given by:
\begin{equation} \begin{array}{c} \frac{dh}{dt}=v \\\
(m_s+m_p)\frac{dv}{dt}=-(m_s+m_p)g+\dot{m}_pv_e-\frac{1}{2}\rho v|v|AC_D \end{array} \end{equation}
 $h$ is the altitude of the rocket. $m_s$=50kg is the weight of the rocket shell. $g$=9.81 $\frac{m}{s^2}$ $\rho$=1.091 $\frac{kg}{m^3}$ is the average air density (assumed constant throughout flight).</description>
